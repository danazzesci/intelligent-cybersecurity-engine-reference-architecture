# Intelligent Cybersecurity Engine – Reference Architecture

## Purpose
This repository defines a reference architecture for an intelligent cybersecurity engine whose primary function is to maintain alignment between:

- Declared risk intent and governance commitments
- Observable system behavior and testing
- Evidence suitable for executive, regulatory, and fiduciary scrutiny

This is an **architecture and evidence framework**, not a product.

## What This Is
- A structured model for BELIEF → TEST → TRUTH → DRIFT → OPEN ISSUE
- An evidence loop designed to support accountable decision-making
- A governance-aligned approach to intelligent security operations

## What This Is Not
- Not an autonomous security decision-maker
- Not a replacement for human governance or accountability
- Not a guarantee of security outcomes

## Repository Structure
- `/docs` – Architecture narrative, governance model, concepts
- `/diagrams` – Reference diagrams
- `/schemas` – Structured artifacts (beliefs, tests, drift, issues)
- `/examples` – Illustrative scripts or samples (non-production)
