## License & Use Intent (Plain Language)

This project is released under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**.

### What that means — plainly

- This work is **free as in freedom**, not “free as in beer.”
- You are free to **use, study, modify, distribute, and build upon** this work — including for commercial purposes — **as long as you comply with the Apache 2.0 license**.
- The license is the authority. This section is explanatory, not a replacement.

### What this project is for

This work exists to support the **correct governance, operation, and evidence-based stewardship of digital systems** — particularly where security, safety, continuity, legal defensibility, and value creation matter.

It is designed to help organizations:
- Test beliefs against observable reality
- Detect drift between intent and execution
- Produce defensible evidence of care
- Govern digital systems with clarity rather than assumption

### Expectations of good-faith use

While Apache 2.0 permits broad use, this project is shared with the expectation that it will be applied **in good faith**:

- To improve system integrity, reliability, and accountability  
- To reduce harm caused by silent assumptions, unmanaged drift, or misrepresentation  
- To support transparent decision-making rather than obscure it  

Nothing here grants permission to misrepresent capabilities, imply guarantees that do not exist, or use the work to knowingly undermine the integrity of systems, users, or stakeholders.

### No warranties, no magic

This project:
- Makes **no guarantees** of security, safety, or compliance  
- Does **not replace professional judgment, testing, or accountability**  
- Does **not transfer responsibility** from operators, engineers, or leadership  

It provides structure, discipline, and evidence — not absolution.

### In short

You are free to use this work.
You are expected to understand it.
You remain responsible for how it is applied.

That balance is intentional.
