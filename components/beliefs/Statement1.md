# Statement 1 — Executive Cybersecurity Accountability Baseline

The following statement represents the **universal strong belief** most executives hold about their organization’s cybersecurity posture. It reflects how leaders understand responsible decision-making across finance, safety, compliance, and enterprise risk — and how those decisions are expected to withstand scrutiny.

> **“I can stand behind our cybersecurity decisions because we examined the risks that were material to our business and stakeholders, made proportionate choices, and maintained oversight as conditions changed.”**

## Justification

This statement does **not** assert omniscience or omnipresence. It does not claim that leadership knew everything, saw every threat, or could prevent all harm. Nor does it require continuous human awareness of every technical condition inside the enterprise.

Instead, it asserts **governed reasonableness** — that cybersecurity decisions were made using disciplined processes appropriate to uncertainty, scale, and change.

The statement aligns cybersecurity accountability with established executive duties by anchoring it to:

- **Materiality**  
  Risks were identified through reasonable inquiry and prioritization, not exhaustive knowledge of every possible threat.

- **Proportionality**  
  Choices reflected informed tradeoffs, not an expectation of absolute security or infinite investment.

- **Oversight**  
  Mechanisms existed to surface meaningful change, degradation, or deviation without requiring constant executive presence.

Crucially, this belief recognizes that executives govern through **systems of delegation, reporting, and escalation**, not through personal technical awareness. Oversight does not mean seeing everything; it means having credible means to know when something important has changed and to act when it does.

For that reason, this statement is not aspirational. It is a **claim of fact about governance**, not outcomes. When asserted, it implies that the organization can demonstrate:

- how material risks were surfaced,
- how decisions were calibrated to those risks, and
- how changing conditions were detected and brought back to accountable decision-makers.

This makes the statement the **minimum defensible standard** for executive cybersecurity accountability — one that respects the realities of complexity and uncertainty while still demanding evidence of care, judgment, and control.
