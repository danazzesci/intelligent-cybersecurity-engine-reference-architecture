# Executive Cybersecurity Belief Clusters  
*A map of executive mental models*

Below is a clean clustering of belief lists grouped by underlying belief patterns.  
Each cluster contains both the common/implicit beliefs and the well-intended, thoughtful variants that live in the same mental space.

These clusters provide a foundation for:
- Diagnostics  
- Progression models  
- Board conversations  
- Belief-to-evidence translation
