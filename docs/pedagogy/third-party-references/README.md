# Third-Party References

This directory contains **external, third-party materials** referenced by or relevant to the *Intelligent Cybersecurity Engine (ICE)* project.

These materials are **not authored by this project**, **not controlled by this repository**, and **not incorporated as normative requirements** unless explicitly stated elsewhere. They are preserved here to support transparency, traceability, comparative analysis, and scholarly review.

---

## Purpose of This Folder

The purpose of this directory is to:

- Maintain a **curated record of influential external sources**
- Preserve **context and provenance** for ideas, standards, and regulatory expectations referenced by ICE
- Support **analysis, comparison, and critique** without rewriting or paraphrasing original works
- Avoid link rot by anchoring key reference artifacts used in reasoning

This folder exists to make clear **what informed the architecture** — not to claim ownership or endorsement of external material.

---

## Nature of the Contents

Materials in this directory may include:

- Standards and framework documents (e.g., regulatory texts, security frameworks)
- Academic papers or research publications
- Vendor whitepapers or technical documentation
- Government or regulatory guidance
- Industry reports and analyses

Unless otherwise noted:
- These materials are **read-only**
- Their original licensing and copyright terms apply
- Inclusion does **not** imply endorsement or compliance claims

---

## How These References Are Used

Third-party references may be used to:

- Illustrate regulatory or fiduciary expectations
- Contrast different approaches to cybersecurity and AI
- Validate that ICE’s design choices align with broader scientific or governance trends
- Anchor pedagogical explanations in existing literature

They are **inputs to reasoning**, not outputs of the architecture.

---

## Normative vs Informative Use

By default, all materials in this directory are **informative**, not normative.

If any reference is treated as:
- Normative (required)
- Binding
- Directly operationalized

That status will be explicitly documented elsewhere in the repository.

Absent such designation, references here should be understood as **contextual and explanatory only**.

---

## Change Discipline

This directory should be managed conservatively.

- Do not modify third-party content unless required for formatting or accessibility
- Do not remove references that are cited elsewhere without updating those citations
- Clearly document the source, date, and version of each artifact when possible

This preserves auditability and intellectual honesty.

---

## Legal Notice

All third-party materials retain their original copyrights and licenses.

Nothing in this directory:
- Transfers ownership
- Grants additional rights
- Overrides original license terms

Users are responsible for complying with the licensing terms of any third-party material they use.

---

## Relationship to the ICE Project

This directory supports ICE by:
- Providing **evidentiary context**
- Enabling **external validation**
- Preventing undocumented assumptions about influence or originality

It reinforces the project’s core principle:  
**explicit sources, explicit intent, no silent inheritance.**
