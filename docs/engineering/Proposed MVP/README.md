# ICE RA — Proposed MVP Architecture

## Overview

This directory contains the **Proposed Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** materials for the **Intelligent Cybersecurity Engine Reference Architecture (ICE RA)**.

The contents here describe a **deliberately minimal, test-first instantiation** of ICE RA intended to validate:

- The **end-to-end flow** of belief → evidence → evaluation → oversight  
- The **separation of belief, evidence, reasoning, and authority**  
- The feasibility of producing **XRESULT-style outputs** from real security artifacts  
- The ability to implement ICE RA using **commodity infrastructure and flexible technology choices**

> **Important status note**  
> As of the date this material is posted here to GitHub, **the Proposed MVP has not been tested in a live lab or production environment**.  
> These artifacts represent a **design hypothesis and implementation proposal**, not a validated system.

## Purpose of the MVP

The MVP is designed to answer a narrow but foundational question:

> **Can we operationally test whether stated cybersecurity beliefs align with observed reality, without collapsing belief, evidence, and authority into a single system?**

The MVP intentionally prioritizes:
- epistemic correctness,
- architectural clarity, and
- falsifiability

over completeness, automation, or performance.

If the architecture fails at this stage, that failure is considered a **successful outcome**, because it prevents false confidence later.

## What This Directory Contains

### 1. Proposed MVP Architecture

A written description of the **minimum components and flows** required to instantiate ICE RA in its simplest credible form.

Key characteristics:
- Deterministic logic may be co-located on a **single Linux host**
- Beliefs are **input per run** (manually or via script)
- Security test results are **ingested**, not generated by ICE RA
- Model usage is **bounded and optional**
- All remediation and decisions remain **human-governed**

This establishes the **smallest possible system** that still preserves ICE RA’s core constraints.

---

### 2. Proposed MVP Flow Diagram (ASCII)

An ASCII diagram showing the **logical flow of the MVP**, including:

- External belief artifacts and security test results
- Deterministic ingestion, normalization, and DELTA computation
- Bounded invocation of a model (MODEL X)
- XRESULT formatting and storage
- Human security oversight review and disposition

The diagram emphasizes **roles and boundaries**, not deployment scale or vendor tooling.

---

### 3. MVP Technology Variations (Permutation Tables)

A set of tables enumerating **valid MVP permutations**, showing how the same architectural outcomes can be achieved using different combinations of:

- hardware (commodity servers, laptops, air-gapped labs),
- software runtimes (scripts, containers, serverless),
- infrastructure models (on-prem, IaaS, PaaS),
- and services (SaaS model APIs, managed databases).

These variations exist to explicitly prevent assumptions such as:
- “this requires the cloud,”
- “this requires a private model,” or
- “this requires a specific vendor stack.”

All permutations listed are **architecturally equivalent** as long as the constraints are preserved.

---

## What the MVP Is *Not*

The Proposed MVP is **not**:

- a production security platform,
- a continuous monitoring system,
- an automated remediation engine,
- a compliance attestation solution,
- or a validated control framework.

Those concerns are intentionally deferred until the **epistemic model** has been proven.

---

## Success Criteria

The MVP is considered successful if it can:

- Ingest real belief artifacts and real security test outputs
- Produce repeatable, inspectable, machine-readable XRESULT-style outputs
- Clearly surface where belief matches or diverges from observed reality
- Preserve human authority over interpretation and action
- Maintain a longitudinal record of results for later review

Failure to meet these criteria indicates that the architecture requires revision.

---

## How to Read These Materials

- Treat everything here as **proposed and testable**, not authoritative
- Expect assumptions to be challenged and refined
- Focus on **flows, boundaries, and responsibilities**, not tooling
- Use the MVP permutations to reason about **feasibility in constrained environments**

---

## Next Steps (Out of Scope for This Directory)

Potential follow-on work includes:
- live lab validation,
- hardening of security zones and trust boundaries,
- formal schema definitions,
- threat modeling,
- and production deployment profiles.

Those steps are intentionally excluded from this directory.
