# XRESULTS — Governance Outcomes for the Intelligent Cybersecurity Engine

## Purpose

XRESULTS define the **governance-grade outcomes** produced by the Intelligent Cybersecurity Engine (ICE).

They do **not** describe controls, tools, or detections.

They describe **what must be demonstrably true** for leadership to:
- Make defensible risk decisions
- Explain those decisions under scrutiny
- Preserve legal, operational, and fiduciary integrity

Each XRESULT represents a **verifiable outcome**, supported by evidence produced by the ICE operating loop.

---

## Structure of an XRESULT

Each XRESULT is defined across three layers:

1. **Summary**  
   A concise statement of the outcome that must be achieved and evidenced.

2. **Justification** *(to be expanded)*  
   Why this outcome is necessary from governance, legal, operational, or fiduciary perspectives.

3. **Examples** *(to be expanded)*  
   Concrete scenarios showing how the XRESULT manifests in real systems, incidents, or decisions.

This repository initially defines **XRESULT summaries only**.
Justifications and examples will be added incrementally.

## The XRESULTS

| XRESULT | Title | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| XRESULT-01 | Risk Commitments Are Explicit and Declared | Summary defined |
| XRESULT-02 | Expected State Is Machine-Interpretable | Summary defined |
| XRESULT-03 | Observed State Is Continuously Measured | Summary defined |
| XRESULT-04 | Declared Belief and Observed Truth Are Compared | Summary defined |
| XRESULT-05 | Drift Is Detectable and Attributable | Summary defined |
| XRESULT-06 | Drift Is Returned as an Open Issue | Summary defined |
| XRESULT-07 | Decision Authority Is Explicitly Assigned | Summary defined |
| XRESULT-08 | Risk-Commitment Traceback Is Preserved | Summary defined |
| XRESULT-09 | Evidence Supports Explainability Under Scrutiny | Summary defined |
| XRESULT-10 | Controls Are Proportionate to Declared Risk | Summary defined |
| XRESULT-11 | Governance Decisions Are Auditable Over Time | Summary defined |
| XRESULT-12 | Outcomes Reinforce Organizational Trust | Summary defined |

Each XRESULT links to its own definition file.

## Relationship to the ICE Operating Loop

XRESULTS are produced through the interaction of:

- **BELIEF** — declared intent, expectations, and commitments  
- **TRUTH** — observed system state derived from testing and telemetry  
- **DRIFT** — detected divergence between BELIEF and TRUTH  
- **OPEN ISSUES** — governance-relevant deltas requiring disposition  

XRESULTS represent the **governance signal** emitted by this loop.

They are consumed by humans.

## Status and Maturity

- XRESULT summaries are considered **stable**
- Justifications and examples are **intentionally deferred**
- No XRESULT implies autonomous decision-making by ICE

ICE informs decisions.  
Humans remain accountable.
